**Changelog:**
__Bot update - 2.0.1 - Message out - Slash-Commands in!__
New Stuff:
- A command to bridge til we get message intent from discord: /send
As per request by Discord, to get a message intent:
- The bot now has a reporting feature, to report any harmful messages: /report
- The bot now also has a short Privacy policy, saying that we don't store any messages in the backend database. (duh)

Important Changes:
- All commands have been moved to the all and new Slash-Commands:tm: (`/`)
- Implemented new message style in preparation to add discord invites
- Safer setup: no more code leaks from the bot! Amazing! (ephemeral messages)

Boring Bug Fixes:
- Moved bot to a new server, where there is more control, if something happens
- Better webhook finding

Planned for the Future:
- add discord invite link
- check nsfw channels
- Telegram support
- Guilded support
- user and server blacklist
